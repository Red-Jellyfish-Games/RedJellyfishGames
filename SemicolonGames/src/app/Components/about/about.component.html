<h3>Jeroen</h3>
<p> I have alwasy been really interested in computers and electronics in a general sense. Even when i was younger i used to play with systems or try and find out how they worked.
    <br> Once I signed up for the University of Utrecht, I really got into coding and all that it entails. I now have a bachelors in Gametech and plan on doing a masters in security.
